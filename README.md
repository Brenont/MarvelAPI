## Getting the Key

After clone the repository you need to get the keys. Then acess marvel developer: https://developer.marvel.com/, and click in "Get a Key"

With the private key and the public key you will create the environment.js and insert the code bellow there

```sh
const environmentKeys = {
  privateKey: "0f00f00f000f00f0000f0",
  publicKey: "000f000ff00ff000f"
}

```

Just it, study the API and enjoy ;)
